# AGL

AGL (Athang’s Game Libraries) is a collection of minimal, dependency-light C libraries for building graphical applications and games. Each library is designed to be independently usable while following shared conventions that allow them to compose naturally. AGL prioritizes simplicity, explicit APIs, and fast iteration over feature completeness.

## Libraries
- [agl_gfx.h](./agl_gfx.h) - window management, user input, 2d and 3d renderer 
- [agl_math.h](./agl_math.h) - vectors, quaternions, matrices
- [agl_phys.h](./agl_phys.h) - particlss, rigid bodies, articulated joints
